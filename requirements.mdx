description: 'All the requirements for BlackLab WAF'
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Ruby **2.5 or higher**
  - Rack **1.0 or higher**
</Info>

BlackLab WAF is a **Rack middleware**, which means it plugs into the Ruby web server interface.  
If you are using **Rails**, **Sinatra**, or any other Rack-based framework, you already meet this requirement.  

---

## What is Rack?

Rack is a minimal interface between **Ruby web servers** and **Ruby web applications**.  
It provides a consistent API so middleware like **BlackLab** can inspect and filter incoming requests before they reach your app.  

For example, in a `config.ru` file:

```ruby
require "rack"
require "black_lab"

use BlackLab::Middleware
run MyApp
```

This ensures all HTTP requests go through BlackLab WAF before being handled by your app.

## Supported frameworks

BlackLab works out-of-the-box with any Rack-compatible framework, such as:

- Ruby on Rails
- Sinatra
- Hanami
- Padrino

Or plain Rack apps
