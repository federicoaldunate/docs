Cross-Site Scripting (**XSS**) is a vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious scripts into your web pages, which are then executed in users’ browsers.

---

## Example attack

```html
<input value="<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>">
```

If the app renders this input without proper sanitization, the script runs in the browser.

## How BlackLab helps
BlackLab’s XSS plugin detects and blocks attempts to inject scripts, including:

`<script>` tags

Event handlers like `onclick`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`, etc.

Encoded payloads (`%3Cscript%3E`)

Example configuration:

```ruby

BlackLab.configure do |config|
  config.plugins = [
    BlackLab::Plugins::XssPlugin.new(weight: 3)
  ]
end
```

<Note> XSS can steal user sessions or manipulate content in the browser. BlackLab stops malicious scripts before they reach your users. </Note>
