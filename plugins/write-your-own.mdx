## Write Your Own Plugin

BlackLab WAF allows you to create **custom plugins** to detect specific attack patterns or application-specific threats.  

You can define your own rules, assign weights, and decide what happens when a request exceeds your threshold.  

---

## Example

A custom plugin could, for instance, block requests containing certain headers or patterns unique to your app.  
The plugin would be added to your configuration like any built-in plugin:

```ruby
BlackLab.configure do |config|
  config.plugins = [
    MyCustomPlugin.new(weight: 2)
  ]
end
```
