SQL Injection (**SQLi**) is a vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious SQL code into your queries, potentially exposing or modifying your database.

---

## Example attack

```http
GET /users?id=1 OR 1=1
```
Without proper protection, this could return all users or allow the attacker to modify data.

How BlackLab helps
BlackLabâ€™s SQLi plugin scans incoming requests for patterns like:

Suspicious SQL keywords (SELECT, UNION, DROP, etc.)

Tautologies `(OR 1=1)`

Comment-based injections `(--, #)`

Example configuration:

```ruby

BlackLab.configure do |config|
  config.plugins = [
    BlackLab::Plugins::SqliPlugin.new(weight: 3)
  ]
end
```
<Note> SQL Injection is one of the most dangerous attacks. BlackLab blocks malicious SQL patterns before they reach your database. </Note>
