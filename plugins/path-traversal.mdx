Path Traversal is a vulnerability where an attacker tries to access files outside the intended directory by using patterns like `../`.

---

## Example attack

```http
GET /download?file=../../etc/passwd
If not protected, this could expose sensitive files from the server.

How BlackLab helps
BlackLabâ€™s Path Traversal plugin blocks suspicious patterns such as:
```
../ or ..%2F
```
Attempts to escape the application directory

Direct access to restricted system files
